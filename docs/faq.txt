<b>How can I update ursina?</b>

pip install git+https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git --upgrade




<b>How can I move the camera?</b>

The camera is an Entity, so you can move and rotate it just like everything else:
camera.position = Vec3(1,1,0)




<b>How can I build and distribute my game?</b>

Open cmd in the project folder and run
pyhton -m ursina.build
It will then move the necessary files to a 'build' directory.




<b>Why should I use Python for game development. Isn't it slow?</b>

Not really. The most performance critical part are written in C++ or shader code.
Python can make you more productive as a developer and thus make it easier
to structure your project in a good way, rather than micro-optimize.




<b>How can I call a function with a delay?</b>

# code
    invoke(some_function, arg1, kwarg1='some kwarg', delay=2)
# text




<b>How can I add lights?</b>

If all you want are some simple lights to make 3D shapes look more interesting,
look at the program 'lights.py' in the samples folder.  For anything more complicated,
you are on your own.
