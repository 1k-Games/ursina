Installing ursina
# normal, size 1


1) Install Python 3.6 or newer. https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Open cmd/terminal and type:
# code
    pip install ursina
# text


If you want to install the newest version from GitHub, you can install like this:
# code
    pip install https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina/archive/master.zip
# text

or

# code
    pip install git+https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git
# text

Keep in mind that things *could* break.


If you want to easily edit the source, it's recommended to clone the git
repo and install as develop like this. Make sure you have git installed. https://git-scm.com/
# code
    git clone https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git
    python setup.py develop
# text

Also install any of the optional dependencies you want from the list below,
or install them all with:
# code
    pip install ursina[extras]
# text


On some systems you might have to use pip3 instead of pip in order to use Python 3 and not the old Python 2.
If the pip command is not found, you can use:
# code
python -m pip install ursina
# text


3) If everything went well, you can go to the introduction tutorial where
   we'll cover how to create a basic program and how to run it.

## Troubleshooting

<b>ursina installed sucessfully, but python can't find it when I try to run a script</b>

If you're using a venv, make sure you're installing it to the venv and not to the default location.
Alternatively you can just not use a venv.
