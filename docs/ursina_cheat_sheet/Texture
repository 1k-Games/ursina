Texture(name, PIL.Image)

example: print(entity.texture.width)

name
path
size
width
height
pixels
filtering = False

get_pixel(x,y)
get_pixels(start, end)
set_pixel(x, y, color)
apply() #call this to show changes after set_pixel()


Assign a texture to an entity like this:
example: entity.texture = 'name_of_the_texture'
It will find the texture as long as it is in the project folder.

You can call compress_textures(name=None) to compress .psd files
Pass texture names in name argument if you don't want to compress all the textures.
