HotReloader(**kwargs)

Reloads your code without having to open a new window.
Press Ctrl+R to reload. It will then clear the scene and re-execute the script.

By default it will try to reload __file__, where you created the HotReloader instance,
but you can change the path by setting file_path attribute to a pathlib.Path.
